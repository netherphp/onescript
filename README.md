# Nether OneScript

A silly Javascript "Compiler"

The only things I dislike more than Javascript are other people's Javascript
frameworks and build systems. So like a complete tool I wrote my own that
works in the way I typically build my scripts.


# Use Case

Pretending our website project is setup like this.

* Our Project Root: `/opt/website`
* Our Public Root: `/opt/website/www`
* A JS Lib We Wrote: `/opt/website/www/share/mylib`

And our JS Lib `mylib` is structured like this.

* `src/mylib-main.js`
* `src/mylib-whatever.js`
* `src/libs/extension1.js`
* `src/libs/extension2.js`

`php vendor/bin/nether-onescript help` in the offchance someone looks at this before
we get back home.
